# calorie-counter

The calorie counter will count the daily intake of calories of a person. The calorie counter first prompts the user to input gender and age, and then it will assign the proper maximum of calories per day. The user can add as many descriptions of foods and the corresponding calories. The calorie counter can give you an overview of the calories counted for the day and return the inputted descriptions of each food if you need to change something or remove something. The calorie counter can warn the user if they are getting close or have passed the maximum calorie of the day. The calorie counter can track your calories over a week or months.
